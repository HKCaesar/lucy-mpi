\subsection*{Parallelisation calculations }

according to armdales law the fraction of time the program will take is defined by
\[
 (1-P) + \frac{P}{S}
 \]
 
for MPI P = 0.989, for OpenMP P = 0.997 and S = number of cores thus

\[
 MPITime = ((0.011) + \frac{0.989}{Cores})*Time
 \]
 
 and
 
\[
 OpenMPTime = ((0.003) + \frac{0.997}{Cores})*Time
 \]
 
 For calculating the cost of the systems.
 
\[
 Cost = InitalCost + CostPerDay * Time
 \] 
 
 The Time the system ran for was given by the previous equations for MPITime and OpenMPTime rearranging this to be in terms of cores gave
 
\[
Cores = \frac{0.989}{\frac{MPITime}{Time} - 0.011}
\]
 
 For the Amazon EC2 system there was no inital cost and the cost per hour was \$1.60. The \$1.60 provided a system that had twenty cores with each core running at \%80 the speed of the inital test systems. This gave a cost per day of \(1.60 * 24 * 0.8 / 20 = 1.536\).
 
 This meant for the MPI solution the cost
