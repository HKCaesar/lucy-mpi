\section{Implemented code}

The implemented solution utilized the functionallity of both MPI and OpenMP. The code executed in a series of steps as follows

\item Load the psf
\item Send the psf to all the processes using MPI
\item Get a list of images present on the master computer in ./Images
\item Send an image to each of the slave processes using MPI
\item Each of the slaves processes the image using the Richardson-Lucy implemented in which OpenMP has been used to speed up the convolutions.
\item The master retrives the image from the slave saves it
\item The master sends the slave a new image
