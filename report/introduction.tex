\section*{Introduction}

A satellite has taken 10 million 1024 X 1024 double precision images of a region. Unfortunately the images have been blurred. A Richardson-Lucy deconvolution filter was believed to be able to remove the blur however taking around 25 seconds an image one processor would take five years to correct all the images. This report looks at the construction and feasibility of using a parallel program that makes use of MPI or OpenMP to deblur the images in a fast and cost effective arrangement

\subsection*{Recommendation}
I recommend that six 3.0 GHz quad-core machines be brought for the task costing around \$6000. Running a MPI implementation of the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution on these machines will take around 110 days to process all 10 million images. This option is a balance between time and budget that also has the bonus of providing the company with six high end computers at the end of the project that can either be reused or sold to gain back some of the invested money.
