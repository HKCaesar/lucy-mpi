\section{Conclusion}

Three options appear particularly good value depending on how pressing the time constraints of the task are. All three of the options make use of the MPI program due to its superior value for money.

Option 1) 50 days for \$12000 using the Amazon EC2 server and 290 EC2 processors. This option emphicises speed over everything else with as many cores as will make any cost effective difference being used to get things done as fast as possiable

Option 2) 110 days for \$6000 using six 3.0 Ghz quad-core machines brought for the task. This option is a balance between time and budget that also has the bonus of providng the company with six high end computers at the end of the project that can either be reused or sold to gian back some of the invested money.

Option 3) 305 days for \$1820 using the Amazon EC2 server and 20 EC2 processors. This option looks at doing the task for as little as possible and takes advantage of the large 1 year discont that Amazon offers. As a bonus this would also give the company an extra 60 days of processor time to run other tasks.  


My recommendation is the second option as this balances the speed of the data with a low price.
